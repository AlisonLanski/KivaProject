# KivaProject
Kiva (founded in 2005) is a microlending organization with global reach. This project investigates two questions based on the Kiva Loans data (https://www.kiva.org/build/data-snapshots) released in 2018. 

1) Are loans requested from Africa are funded at a different rate than loans requested from other continents?
2) Can sentiment scores, calculated from loan applications, provide an indication if a loan will be fully-funded?

These questions were chosen to demonstrate a range of techniques.  They are also the types of questions which might help inform marketing decisions for Kiva (related to requestor-location) or might help loan-requestors write more compelling applications. 

This repository includes the R code used for analysis and results, a knitted report (HTML) for ease of viewing, and a PDF version of the HTML report. The code and report were produced for coursework; they have not been altered since then.
